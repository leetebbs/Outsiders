Video I followed  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZWCzsB1xUE to get it working.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
